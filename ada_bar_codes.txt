Intro to Ada Bar Codes
======================

The project Ada Bar Codes provides a package for generating
various types of bar codes on different output formats,
such as PDF, SVG or bitmaps.

The creation of a bar code is as simple as this small procedure:

  with Bar_Codes; use Bar_Codes;
  with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

  procedure Small_demo is 
    svg : File_Type;
  begin 
    Create (svg, Out_File, "bar_code.svg");
    Put_Line (svg, "<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>");
    Put_Line (svg, SVG_Bar_Code (Code_128, 57.0, 23.0, "mm", "Hello"));
    Close (svg);
  end;

Warning & legal
===============
There is NO WARRANTY in this software. Read copyright notice in bar_codes.ads.

Portability
===========
This software can be compiled for any target machine, and with any compiler
for Ada 2005 or later language versions.

How to build Ada Bar Codes and its demo
=======================================
Here is how to build with GNAT/GCC:

    - type "gprbuild -p -P bar_codes_gnat" in the command line
or
    - open the bar_codes_gnat.gpr file (will launch the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS)),
      press F4 (Build)

Here is how to build with ObjectAda (tested with v.9.2):
    - open the bar_codes_oa.prj file, press F7 (Build)

As a result there is a bar_codes_demo[.exe] executable.
